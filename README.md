# üß™ Test Cases

## Detailed Test Cases Implementation and Expectations

This document outlines the detailed test cases designed to validate the functionality and robustness of our application. Each test case is implemented with specific functions and aims to test various aspects of the application, including data manipulation, performance, and error handling.

### Test Group 1: Clerk Functionality Testing

#### TEST #1 - Clerk Functionality

- **Function Tested**: `Clerk.getClerkId`
- **Description**: Ensures the application can retrieve a Clerk ID successfully.
- **Execution Method**: The function is executed and its performance is timed.
- **Detailed Steps**:
  - **Step 0: Clean-up**: Initial database clean-up is performed to ensure a clean state.
  - **Step 1: Retrieve Clerk ID**: The `Clerk.getClerkId` function is called, and its execution time is measured.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The Clerk ID is retrieved successfully within an acceptable time frame.
  - **Implementation Code**: `Test_1` function.

### Test Group 2: Organ Functionality Testing

#### TEST #2 - Organ Functionality

- **Functions Tested**:
  - `Organ.pushOrgan` for adding new organ entries.
  - `Organ.getOrgans` for retrieving a list of all organ entries.
  - `Organ.popOrgan` for removing a specific organ entry.
  - `Organ.popOrgans` for removing all organ entries.
- **Description**: Tests the application's ability to manage organ data within the database.
- **Detailed Steps**:
  - **Step 0: Clean-up**: Ensure no organ entries exist before the test begins.
  - **Create Organs**: Multiple organs are added, and their creation times are measured.
  - **Retrieve Organs**: Tests retrieval of all organ entries after creation.
  - **Delete Specific Organ**: Removes a specific organ and tests deletion performance.
  - **Delete All Organs**: Tests the removal of all organ entries and ensures the operation's success.
  - **Expected Outcomes**: Each function performs as expected, with organ data being accurately manipulated and retrieved.
  - **Implementation Code**: `Test_2` function.

# üìÉ Functions Library Documentation

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the custom functions library used in the application. The library is divided into three main segments: `Util`, `Helper`, and `Do`. Each segment targets different aspects of the application, from utility functions to specialized helpers and direct action methods.

## Util

The `Util` segment is designed to provide utility functions that simplify common operations, such as database interactions and data manipulation.

### Other

- **`twJoin` and `twMerge`**: Utility functions from `tailwind-merge` for handling Tailwind CSS class mergers and conditionals.
- **`returnHandle`**: A higher-order function designed to streamline asynchronous operations, handling both the success and error paths with custom messages.

### Clerk

- **`getClerkId`**: Retrieves the Clerk user ID, ensuring the user is authenticated.

### DataBase

Provides a set of functions to interact with the database entities like `Organ`, `User`, `Lead`, `Chat`, and `Message`.

#### Organ

- **`pushOrgan`**: Creates a new organ entry in the database.
- **`popOrgan`**: Deletes a specified organ entry by its ID.
- **`getOrgan`**: Retrieves a specific organ entry by its ID.
- **`popOrgans`**: Deletes all organ entries.
- **`getOrgans`**: Fetches all organ entries.

#### User

- **`pushUser`**: Adds a new user to the database, linking it to an organ.
- **`getUser`**: Retrieves a user by their Clerk ID.

#### Lead

- **`pushLead`**: Adds a new lead, optionally linking it to an organ and including contact information.
- **`popLead`**: Removes a specified lead by ID.
- **`getLead`**: Fetches a specific lead by ID.
- **`getLeads`**: Retrieves all leads linked to a specified organ.
- **`popLeads`**: Deletes all leads associated with a specific organ.

The `Helper` segment is focused on providing support functions that integrate external services or complex logic not directly related to database operations.

### Chat

- **`getAiResponse`**: Interacts with an AI service to get responses based on a lead's message. It handles thread creation and message logging within the chat.

## Do

`Do` includes functions that perform specific actions or business logic, often combining multiple utility functions to achieve a task.

### User

- **`Onboarding`**: Handles the onboarding process for new users, ensuring they are registered and linked to a new organ if necessary.

### Lead

- **`getLead`**: Retrieves details for a specific lead.
- **`getLeads`**: Fetches all leads associated with the user's organ.
